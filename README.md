A Cargo [build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) library that
helps to dynamically link a Rust project to a Cabal [foreign library](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-package.html#foreign-libraries).

See [`examples/basic`](./examples/basic) for a basic usage example.
